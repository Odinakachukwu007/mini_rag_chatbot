(Acts 3:21)
By Elder DavidÂ A. Bednar
Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
The most important and glorious â"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng,"good newsâ is the message that the Lord Jesus Christ has restored His gospel and Church in the latter days.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized 195 years ago today, on AprilÂ 6, 1830.
A small congregation of believers and friends gathered for this momentous and joyous occasion. A great outpouring of the Spirit blessed all in attendance as the ordinance of the sacrament was administered, the gift of the Holy Ghost was conferred, priesthood ordinations were performed, and truths of the gospel of Jesus Christ were preached.
In reestablishing His Church, the Lord designated by revelation 24-year-old Joseph Smith as its earthly leader: âa seer, a translator, a prophet, an apostle of Jesus Christ, an elder of the church through the will of God the Father, and the grace of your Lord Jesus Christ.â
I earnestly pray for the help of the Holy Ghost as we consider the importance and ongoing impact of this singular event in the history of the world.
The formal organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was the culmination of a sequence of miraculous experiences. The first of these experiences occurred 10 years earlier in upstate New York.
In the spring of 1820, a young boy named Joseph Smith went into the woods near his home to pray. He had questions regarding the salvation of his soul, and he yearned âto know which"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng," of all the [churches] was right, that [he] might know which to join.â Joseph trusted that God would answer his prayer and direct him.
Please note that Joseph did not pray merely to know what was right. Rather, he prayed to know what was right so he could do what was right. Joseph asked in faith and was determined to act in accordance with the answers he received.
âIn [response] to his [sincere] prayer, God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, appeared to Joseph and inaugurated the ârestitution of all thingsâ (Acts 3:21) as foretold in the Bible. In this vision, he learned that following the death of the original Apostles, Christâs New Testament Church was lost from the earth.â Joseph Smith would be instrumental in restoring once again the doctrine, the authority, and the covenants and ordinances of the Saviorâs ancient Church.
Joseph affirmed: âI saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the otherâThis is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!â
Through this vision and subsequent supernal experiences, Joseph Smith came to understand that God and Jesus Christ knew him as an individual, cared about his eternal salvation, and had"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng," a mission for him to perform. He also learned vital lessons about the attributes, character, and perfections of the Godheadâand that the Father and the Son are separate and distinct Beings. Jesus Christ is the literal Son of God in spirit and in the flesh.
Joseph Smith declared that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are corporeal beings. He said, âThe Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as manâs; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit.â
I testify the visitation of the Father and the Son to Joseph Smith was the initiating event in the grand ârestoration of all things spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets since the world began.â
The second in the sequence of miraculous experiences that led to the formal organization of the Saviorâs restored Church was the translation and coming forth of the Book of Mormon.
âJoseph Smith was given the gift and power of God to translate an ancient record: the Book of MormonâAnother Testament of Jesus Christ. â¦ This sacred text include[s] an account of the personal ministry of Jesus Christ among people in the Western Hemisphere soon after His Resurrection. [The Book of Mormon] teaches of lifeâs purpose and explains the doctrine of Christ, which is central to that purpose. As a companion scripture to the Bible"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng,", the Book of Mormon testifies that all human beings are sons and daughters of a loving Father in Heaven, that He has a divine plan for our lives, and that His Son, Jesus Christ, speaks today as well as in days of old.â
As members of the Saviorâs restored Church, âWe believe the Bible to be the word of God as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.â The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ, confirms the truthfulness of the Bible, and restores plain and precious truths that were lost from the Bible.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the original Church established by the Savior, with its divine authority, doctrine, and covenants and ordinances, was lost from the earth. As part of the prophesied restoration of all things in the latter days, ancient prophets and apostles personally conferred priesthood authority upon Joseph Smith and committed priesthood keys to him. This was the third in the sequence of miraculous experiences that led to the formal organization of the Saviorâs restored Church.
Priesthood authority allows Godâs servants to ârepresent [Him] and act in His name.â âPriesthood keys are the authority to direct the use of the priesthood on behalf of Godâs children.â
Under the direction of the Father and the"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng," Son, the resurrected John the Baptist restored, in 1829, the authority to baptize by immersion for the remission of sins. In that same year, three of the original Twelve ApostlesâPeter, James, and Johnârestored the apostleship and additional priesthood authority and keys.
Six years after the formal organization of the Church, in the Kirtland Temple, Moses, Elias, and Elijah committed to Joseph the additional authority necessary to accomplish Godâs work in the latter days.
Moses committed the keys of the gathering of Israel.
Elias committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, including the restoration of the Abrahamic covenant.
Elijah committed the keys of the sealing power, providing the authority that allows ordinances performed on earth to be binding in eternity, such as joining families together in eternal relationships that transcend death.
As Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon, he received revelations indicating that the Church of Jesus Christ would be reestablished. But the Lord instructed Joseph not to organize His Church immediately. Rather, âby the spirit of prophecy and revelation,â the Lord revealed to Joseph âthe precise day â¦ [he] should proceed to organize His Church once [again] upon the earth.â
The Church was organized in proper sequence only after the restoration of the priesthood and the publication of the Book of Mormon. The first copies of the Book of Mormon became available on"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng," MarchÂ 26, 1830, and the Church was formally organized on AprilÂ 6.
âThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints â¦ is Christâs New Testament Church restored. This Church is anchored in the perfect life of its chief cornerstone, Jesus Christ, and in His infinite Atonement and literal Resurrection. Jesus Christ has once again called Apostles and has given them priesthood authority. He invites all of us to come unto Him and His Church, to receive the Holy Ghost, the ordinances of salvation, and to gain enduring joy.â
The appearance of the Father and the Son to Joseph Smith, the translation and coming forth of the Book of Mormon, and the restoration of priesthood authority and keys were necessary prerequisites to the organization of the Lordâs restored Church 195 years ago today.
In the Old Testament, the prophet Daniel interpreted a dream about a stone that would be cut out of a mountain without hands and fill the entire earth. One year after the organization of the Church, the Lord instructed Joseph Smith that the keys of the kingdom of God had again been âcommitted unto man on the earthâ and the âgospel [of Jesus Christ would] roll forth unto the ends of the earth, as the stone which is cut out of the mountain without hands.â
I testify: The Lord is fulfilling His promise. The Saviorâs restored Church is being established"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng," throughout the world and is the instrument by which God will âgather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him.â
The Lordâs latter-day work âis a cause that has interested the people of God in every age; it is a theme upon which prophets, priests and kings have dwelt with peculiar delight; they have looked forward with joyful anticipation to the day in which we live; and fired with heavenly and joyful anticipations they have sung and written and prophesied of this our day.â
In this greatest and last of all gospel dispensations, âa whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world â¦ shall be revealed â¦ in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.â
The Prophet Joseph further explained, âAll the ordinances and duties that ever have been required by the Priesthood, under the directions and commandments of the Almighty in any of the dispensations, shall all be had in the last dispensation, â¦ bringing to pass the restoration spoken of by the mouth of all the Holy Prophets.â"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng,"
I have attempted to summarize basic elements of the most important and glorious âgood newsâ any person anywhere in the world can ever receiveâthe message that the Lord Jesus Christ has restored His gospel and Church in the latter days.
I invite all to learn about and prove this message. I promise that individuals âwho prayerfully study the message of the Restoration and act in faith will be blessed [through the power of the Holy Ghost] to gain their own witness of its divinity and of its purpose to prepare the world for the promised Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.â As you pray earnestly with the expectation to both receive and act upon an answer from God, as did young Joseph Smith, your capacity to recognize and respond to that divine witness will be increased.
I witness that God, the Eternal Father, is our Father. I testify and witness that Jesus Christ is the Fatherâs Beloved Son and His Only Begotten in the flesh. He is our Savior and Redeemer.
And I joyfully witness that the Father and the Son appeared to the boy Joseph Smith, thus initiating the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the latter days. The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ and contains the word of God. Priesthood authority to represent the Savior and act in His name again is found on the earth. And The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Christâs"
The Times of Restitution of All Things,The First Vision,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/41bednar?lang=eng," New Testament Church restored. I bear my sure witness that all of these things are true in the sacred name of the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

Our Heavenly Fatherâs plan provides helps to guide us through our"
Divine Helps for Mortality,I.,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks?lang=eng," mortal journeys.
Through the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord revealed a few things about our pre-earth life. There we existed as spirit children of God. Because God desired to help His children progress, He decided to create an earth on which we could receive a body, learn through experience, develop divine attributes, and be proven to see if we would keep Godâs commandments. Those who qualified would âhave glory added upon their heads for ever and everâ (Abraham 3:26).
To establish the conditions of this divine plan, God chose His Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. Lucifer, whose suggested alternative would destroy the agency of man, became Satan and was âcast down.â Banished to the earth and denied the privilege of mortal life, Satan was permitted to attempt âto deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto [Godâs] voiceâ (Moses 4:4).
Essential to Godâs great plan for the mortal growth of His children was for them to experience âopposition in all thingsâ (2Â Nephi 2:11). Just as our physical muscles cannot be developed or maintained without straining against the law of gravity, so mortal growth requires us to strain against Satanâs temptations and other mortal opposition. Most important"
Divine Helps for Mortality,I.,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks?lang=eng," for spiritual growth is the requirement to choose between good and evil. Those who choose good would progress toward their eternal destiny. Those who choose evilâas all would do in the various temptations of mortalityâwould need saving help, which a loving God designed to provide.
By far, Godâs strongest mortal help was His provision of a Savior, Jesus Christ, who would suffer to pay the price and provide forgiveness for repented sins. That merciful and glorious Atonement explains why faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel. His Atonement âbringeth to pass the resurrection of the deadâ (Alma 42:23), and it âatone[s] for the sins of the worldâ (Alma 34:8), erasing all of our repented sins and giving our Savior power to succor us in our mortal infirmities.
Beyond that glorious erasing of sins committed and being forgiven, the plan of a loving Father in Heaven provides many other gifts to protect us, including protecting us from sinning in the first place. Our mortal life always begins with a father and a mother. Ideally, both are present, with different gifts to guide our growth. If not, their absence is part of the opposition we must overcome.
Our Heavenly Fatherâs plan provides other helps to guide us through our mortal journeys. I will speak of four of these. Please"
Divine Helps for Mortality,I.,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks?lang=eng," donât hold me to my number of four, because these helps are overlapping. Moreover, there are other merciful protections in addition to these.
First, I speak of the Light or Spirit of Christ. In his great teaching in the book of Moroni, Moroni quotes his father that âthe Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evilâ (Moroni 7:16). We read this same teaching in modern revelations:
âAnd the Spirit giveth light to every man that cometh into the world; and the Spirit enlighteneth every man through the world, that hearkeneth to the voice of the Spiritâ (Doctrine and Covenants 84:46).
Again: âFor my Spirit is sent forth into the world to enlighten the humble and contrite, and to the condemnation of the ungodlyâ (Doctrine and Covenants 136:33).
President Joseph Fielding Smith explained these scriptures: âThe Lord has not left men (when they are born into this world) helpless, groping to find the light and truth, but every man â¦ is born with the right to receive the guidance, the instruction, the counsel of the Spirit of Christ, or Light of Truth.â
The second of the great assistances provided by the Lord to help us choose what is right is a cluster of divine"
Divine Helps for Mortality,I.,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks?lang=eng," directions in the scriptures as part of the plan of salvation (plan of happiness). These directions are commandments, ordinances, and covenants.
Commandments define the path our Heavenly Father has marked out for us to progress toward eternal life. People who imagine commandments as the way God decides who to punish fail to understand this purpose of Godâs loving plan of happiness. On that path, we can gradually achieve the needed relationship with our Savior and qualify for an increase of His power to help us on our way to the destination He desires for all of us. Our Heavenly Father desires all of His children to return to the celestial kingdom, where God and our Savior reside, and to have the kind of life of those who reside in that celestial glory.
Ordinances and covenants are part of the law that defines the path to eternal life. Ordinances, and the sacred covenants we make with God through them, are required steps and essential guardrails along that path. I like to think of the role of covenants as demonstrating that under Godâs plan, His highest blessings are given to those who promise in advance to keep certain commandments and who keep those promises.
Other God-given helps for making right choices are the manifestations of the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. His function, defined in scripture, is to testify of the Father and the Son, to teach us, to bring all things to our rem"
Divine Helps for Mortality,I.,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks?lang=eng,"embrance, and to guide us into all truth. The scriptures include many descriptions of the manifestations of the Holy Ghost, such as a spiritual witness in response to an inquiry about the truth of the Book of Mormon. A manifestation is not to be confused with the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is conferred following baptism.
One of the most significant of Godâs helps for His faithful children is the gift of the Holy Ghost. The importance of this gift is evident in the fact that it is formally conferred after repentance and baptism by water, âand then [the scriptures explain] cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghostâ (2Â Nephi 31:17). Persons who have this remission of sinsâand then regularly renew their cleansing by daily repentance and living according to the covenants they make through the ordinance of the sacramentâqualify for the promise that the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of the Lord, âmay always â¦ be with themâ (Doctrine and Covenants 20:77).
Thus, President JosephÂ F. Smith taught that the Holy Ghost will âenlighten the minds of the people with regard to the things of God, to convince them at the time of their conversion of their having done the will of the Father, and to be in them an abiding testimony as a companion through life, acting"
Divine Helps for Mortality,I.,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks?lang=eng," as the sure and safe guide into all truth and filling them day by day with joy and gladness, with a disposition to do good to all men, to suffer wrong rather than to do wrong, to be kind and merciful, long suffering and charitable. All who possess this inestimable gift, this pearl of great price, have a continual thirst after righteousness. Without the aid of the Holy Spirit,â President Smith concluded, âno mortal can walk in the straight and narrow way.â
With so many powerful helps to guide us in our mortal journeys, it is disappointing that so many remain unprepared for their appointed meeting with our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. His parable of the ten virgins, spoken of so frequently in this conference, suggests that of those invited to meet Him, only half will be prepared.
We all know examples of the unprepared: returned missionaries who have interrupted their spiritual growth by periods of inactivity, youth who have jeopardized their spiritual growth by separating themselves from Church teaching and activities, men who have postponed their ordination to the Melchizedek Priesthood, men and womenâsometimes the posterity of noble pioneers or worthy parentsâwho have departed the covenant path short of making and keeping covenants in the holy temple.
Many of such deviations occur when members fail to follow the fundamental spiritual maintenance plan of personal prayer, regular scripture study, and frequent repentance. In"
Divine Helps for Mortality,I.,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/47oaks?lang=eng," contrast, some neglect weekly renewal of covenants by not partaking of the sacrament. Some say the Church is not meeting their needs; those substitute what they perceive as their future needs ahead of what the Lord has provided in His many teachings and opportunities for our essential service to others.
Humility and trust in the Lord are the remedies for such deviations. As the Book of Mormon teaches, the Lord âdoth bless and prosper those who put their trust in himâ (Helaman 12:1). Trusting in the Lord is a particular need for all who wrongly measure the commandments of God and the teachings of His prophets against the latest findings and wisdom of man.
I have spoken of the many mortal helps our loving Father in Heaven has given to help His children return to Him. Our part in this divine plan is to trust in God and seek and use these divine helps, most notably the Atonement of His Beloved Son, our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ. I pray that we will teach and live these principles, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

As we diligently seek to have charity and virtue fill our lives"
Confidence in the Presence of God,No Speaker Found,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng,", our confidence in approaching God will increase.
My dear brothers and sisters, I am grateful to speak to you today in this important general conference. My eyes continue to get older. Thank you for your understanding as I deliver my message.
We live in a day of great momentum in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I am filled with joy as I see progress in so many areas.
I am especially inspired by our youth. They are giving service in large numbers. They are seeking their ancestors and performing ordinances in the temple. Our young men and women are submitting applications for missionary service in record numbers. The rising generation is rising up as stalwart followers of Jesus Christ.
Recently I met a new great-granddaughter. When I contemplate the challenges she will experience in her life, I feel a great desire to help her build faith in Jesus Christ. Living His gospel is essential for her future happiness.
She, like each of us, will face challenges. We all will experience illness, disappointment, temptation, and loss. These challenges can knock our self-confidence. However, disciples of Jesus Christ have access to a different kind of confidence.
When we make and keep covenants with God, we can have confidence that is born of the Spirit. The Lord told the Prophet Joseph Smith that our confidence can âwax strong in the presence of God.â Imagine the comfort of having confidence in the presence of God!
When I speak of having confidence before God, I am"
Confidence in the Presence of God,No Speaker Found,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng," referring to having confidence in approaching God right now! I am referring to praying with confidence that Heavenly Father hears us, that He understands our needs better than we do. I am referring to having confidence that He loves us more than we can comprehend, that He sends angels to be with us and with those we love. I am referring to having confidence that He yearns to help each of us reach our highest potential.
Now, how do we gain such confidence? The Lord answers this question with these words: âLet thy bowels â¦ be full of charity towards all men,Â â¦ and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God.â
Thereâs the key! In the Lordâs own words, charity and virtue open the way to having confidence before God! Brothers and sisters, we can do this! Our confidence can truly wax strong in the presence of God, right now!
Letâs consider both charity and virtue.
First, charity. Two years ago, I called upon us, as covenant followers of Jesus Christ, to be peacemakers. I repeat what I said then: âAnger never persuades. Hostility builds no one. Contention never leads to inspired solutions.â
True charity towards all men is the hallmark of peacemakers! It is imperative that we have charity in our discourse,"
Confidence in the Presence of God,No Speaker Found,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng," both public and private. I thank those of you who took my previous counsel to heart. But we can still do better.
The present hostility in public dialogue and on social media is alarming. Hateful words are deadly weapons. Contention prevents the Holy Ghost from being our constant companion.
As followers of Jesus Christ, we should lead the way as peacemakers. As charity becomes part of our nature, we will lose the impulse to demean others. We will stop judging others. We will have charity for those from all walks of life. Charity towards all men is essential to our progress. Charity is the foundation of a godly character.
Let us plead with our Heavenly Father to fill our hearts with greater charityâespecially for those who are difficult to loveâfor charity is a gift from our Heavenly Father for true followers of Jesus Christ. The Savior is the Prince of Peace. We are to be His instruments for peace.
Now, let us speak of virtue. The Lord tells us to garnish our thoughts unceasingly with virtue. Imagine the boost you will receive to any positive thought when you enhance it with virtue. Virtue makes everything better and happier! On the other hand, imagine what will happen when you add virtue to an impure thought, a cruel thought, or a depressing thought. Virtue will drive away those thoughts. Virtue will free you from anxious, troublesome thoughts.
Brothers and sisters, as the world grows more wicked, we need"
Confidence in the Presence of God,No Speaker Found,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng," to grow increasingly pure. Our thoughts, words, and actions need to be unfailingly virtuous and filled with the pure love of Jesus Christ towards all men. The great opportunity before us is to become the people God needs us to be.
Regular worship in the house of the Lord increases our capacity for both virtue and charity. Thus, time in the temple increases our confidence before the Lord. Increased time in the temple will help us prepare for the Second Coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ. We do not know the day or the hour of His coming. But I do know that the Lord is prompting me to urge us to get ready for that âgreat and dreadful day.â
As we diligently seek to have charity and virtue fill our lives, our confidence in approaching God will increase. I invite you to take intentional steps to grow in your confidence before the Lord. Then, as we go to our Heavenly Father with increasing confidence, we will be filled with more joy, and your faith in Jesus Christ will increase. We will begin to experience spiritual power that exceeds our greatest hopes.
We are grateful to the Lord for the acceleration of temple-building in recent years. Under His direction, today we announce plans to construct a temple in each of these 15 locations:
